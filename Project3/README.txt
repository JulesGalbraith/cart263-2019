	I think of this project as being a virtual sculpture garden. Initially, I was thinking about emotions- how we access them in others, how they pass between people, how they configure us visually. In greek plays, actors would wear masks that over exaggerated the cast of their features  to signal the performative emotional state they embodied. In the digital fabrication lab, there are handheld scanners that can be used to create stl files of entire objects, with more granularity than can be achieved with a kinect or camera based scanner. A friend in tow, I set out to collect a taxonomy of expressive faces. As it happened, however, the scanner was exceptionally buggy- that, or we were inept at maneuvering it- and I was left with models that were sometimes cast in a recognizable grimace, but were more often patchy, warped, or contained doubled points. None of the files seemed to represent, one-to-one, any identifiable feeling. If, at the outset, I had (fuzzily) hoped to be able to generate some affect or engagement by playing on the cognitive tendency to mirror facial states- that intention became moot. 
	To my mind the capture and expression of human states is work that we are misguided in expecting  our technology to do. Translations are inconsistent, correspondences inexhaustive. I became interested in the distinctions and overlaps between individuals in their physical and digital incarnations. A line of thought that resonates with my intuitions speaks to the quasi-autonomy of the information generated through online actions and interactions- terms for this include the digital subject (Goriunova, 2018), the subject of circulation (Wark, 2018),  Inforgs (Floridi, 1999), or the digital shadow (I can’t cite anyone specifically as I think this term is common parlance at this point). We are constantly shedding data- as distinguished from ‘information’, being in nature raw and lacking context- about ourselves,. It is intrinsically storable, and circulates far beyond the reach of our bodies or our attention. I think back to the trope of those cultures whose members do not wish to be photographed because they believe it fragments and captures a piece of soul. What integrity of ours is compromised as the flip side of our (in name) free use of online spaces? What patchy portraits of us would emerge from this data cloud? Would we recognize ourselves in our data alone?
	This scene brings together objects that, although they appear face-like, are ambiguous in their expression and their relation to any actual- that is to say physical- being. They are mobile and manipulable- however, to interact with any of the figures brings up a basic chat interface, where a cryptic exchange takes place. Although it is implied that the speakers are the faces themselves, the ultimate identity generating the text is indeterminate. The chat text is not actually generated, but was written as a set of unconnected reflections in response to what I was reading over the course of making this. This scene is ultimately a way of thinking through how the self can be understood in the liminal space between embodiment and online diffusion.
