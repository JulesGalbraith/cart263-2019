<div class = "paragraph" id="first"> In recent years, “Information Ethics” (IE) has come to mean <span class = "secret"> different things to different
researchers </span> working in a variety of disciplines, including computer ethics, business
ethics, medical ethics, computer science, <span class = "redacted"> the philosophy of information, social
epistemology and library and information science. </span> Perhaps this Babel was always going
to be <span class = "secret">inevitable </span>, given the novelty of the field and the multifarious nature of the concept
of information itself. </div>

 <div class = "paragraph"> It is certainly unfortunate, for it has generated some confusion
about the specific nature and scope of IE. The problem, however, is not irremediable,
for a <span class = "secret">unified approach </span> can help to <span class= "redacted"> explain and relate the main senses in which IE has
been discussed in the literature. </span> The approach is <span class = "redacted"> best introduced schematically </span> and by
focusing our attention on a <span class = "secret"> moral agent </span> A.</div>


<div class = "paragraph"> Suppose A is interested in pursuing whatever she considers her best course of
action, given her predicament. We shall assume that A’s <span class = "secret"> evaluations and actions have
some moral value </span>, but no specific value needs to be introduced. Intuitively, A can use
some information <span class = "redacted"> (information as a resource) to generate some other information
(information as a product) </span>  and in so doing affect her informational environment
(information as target). Now, since the appearance of the first works in the eighties,2
Information Ethics <span class= "secret"> has been claimed </span> to be the study of <span class = "redacted"> moral issues </span> arising from one or
another of these three distinct “information arrows” (see Figure 1). This, in turn, has
paved the way to a fruitless compartmentalization and false dilemmas, with researchers
either ignoring the <span class = "redacted"> wider scope of IE, or arguing as if only one “arrow” and its
corresponding microethics </span> (that is a <span class = "secret"> practical, field-dependent, applied and professional</span>
ethics) provided the right approach to IE. The limits of such narrowly constructed
interpretations of IE become evident once we look at each “informational arrow” more
closely. </div>
