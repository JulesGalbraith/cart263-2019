The Fig Tree: A Game of Choice and Passing Time
Artist Statement
Jules Galbraith




There is a moment in Camus’ Sisyphus where he writes that Sisyphus, “ returning toward his rock (..) contemplates that series of unrelated actions which become his fate, created by him, combined under his memory's eye and soon sealed by his death.” (Camus, 3). If we understand action as a choice acted upon and lived out, we realize that any movement at all, any deliberation and forwards momentum towards a goal is, in some schema grand enough, a trajectory wherein the human affects only themself. Every choice could have been otherwise; every choice could not have been made at all. In choosing to act, an individual only guarantees the imminence of more choices. They pile up and give themselves again to more choices. There is no resolution, no moment where a person can sit back, certain that things will “play out”. There is no way to set up a life, to run it, to let it live itself and to be moved along with it as it does so. With the relentlessness of choice comes a certain fatigue; figures of cultural and intellectual repute such as Barack Obama and Steve Jobs have been reputed to minimize such fatigue, for instance, by wearing an iteration of the same outfit either day. Another spectre following the necessity of choices made is choices not made, choices turned over, left behind, choices which, through bad timing, personal failure, or simply the impossibility of having everything at once, slip past a person.
In considering the relentlessness of choice, I was reminded of another passage, which often springs to my mind when I am agonizing over choices large or small; the fig tree scene from Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar:

	“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.
 From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. (...)
I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death,
just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.
I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and,
as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one,
they plopped to the ground at my feet.”

	In this passage, every fig is a future, a choice made and moved towards. As one is plucked- not even, as a single fig is considered, they all wither. It is almost as if deliberating on a choice leads only to the certainty of being backed into a corner as options fade in time. Are we foolish to think ourselves agents, free to choose, free to see our choices realized? Maybe, on a more positive note, we should take this to free ourselves from the future-tainting sense of anxiety that envelops choice, and act on less reflective instincts. It may be the best we can get. This passage provided inspiration for the visual elements of my program. I was also thinking about liminal spaces, purgatories, the Asphodel Fields (to bring it back to greek mythology), which I hoped to get at with the soft colour palate and disembodied button prompts.
